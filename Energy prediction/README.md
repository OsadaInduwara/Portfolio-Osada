# Signal Tower Energy Prediction

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the energy consumption of signal towers for a specific service provider's sites. The goal is to develop accurate models that can forecast the energy usage for the upcoming months. By analyzing various features such as call data usage, internet usage, unique options, specific equipment's data, and more, we aim to optimize energy management and resource allocation for signal towers.

## Methodology

The project utilizes a combination of autoML techniques and deep learning algorithms to design and train prediction models. These methods enable us to automate the model selection and hyperparameter tuning process, ensuring optimal performance. The key steps involved in the methodology are as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing: The raw dataset is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. Feature Analysis: Advanced feature analysis techniques are applied to identify the most relevant features for predicting energy consumption. This includes assessing feature importance, correlation analysis, and dimensionality reduction.

3. Model Selection: The autoML techniques are employed to evaluate various algorithms and select the best-performing model. This allows us to leverage the strengths of different algorithms and find the most suitable approach for our prediction task.

4. Model Training: The selected model architecture, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model learns the patterns and relationships between the input features and the target variable (energy consumption).

5. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or coefficient of determination (R-squared). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the model.

6. Prediction and Deployment: The trained model is utilized to make energy consumption predictions for new data points. The model can be deployed in a production environment to support real-time energy management and decision-making.
