# Fraud Detection Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a fraud detection project. The project focuses on developing a machine learning model to effectively detect fraudulent transactions. The README.md file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, key features, data, dependencies, usage instructions, and results.

## Project Description

The fraud detection project aims to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions within a given dataset. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform the raw transaction data to prepare it for analysis and model training. This step may include tasks such as handling missing values, data normalization, and feature scaling.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the transaction data that can help differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This could involve creating new features, aggregating information, or applying domain-specific knowledge.

3. Model Selection and Training: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms suitable for classification tasks, such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting. Train and fine-tune the selected model using the prepared dataset.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, consider using techniques like cross-validation or stratified sampling to ensure robustness of the evaluation.

5. Threshold Optimization: Adjust the classification threshold of the model to achieve the desired balance between false positives and false negatives based on the specific requirements of the application.

6. Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance in a production environment, collect new data, and retrain or update the model as necessary to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

## Data

Describe the dataset used for the fraud detection project. Provide details about the source of the data, its format, and the features present. If the dataset cannot be shared due to privacy or confidentiality reasons, mention the general characteristics of the data without disclosing sensitive information.
